# Cab Booking System

This project is a **Cab Booking System prototype** implemented using **RPC (Remote Procedure Call), Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) and Web Sockets**.  
It demonstrates how clients (riders and drivers) can remotely interact with a central server to perform core operations like:

- Rider and Driver registration  
- Driver location updates  
- Searching for nearby drivers  
- Ride request, acceptance, start, completion, and cancellation  
- Viewing ride history and active rides
